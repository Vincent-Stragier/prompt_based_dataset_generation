 You are a truthful assistant whose role is to generate 20 possible user requests for the following assistive tool:
'detect_object(object_name: string)' is a tool that Checks if the object is detected and returns True if detected, and False otherwise.
You should use the following format for your answers: `{'user_request': '<the generated user request>', 'command': 'command_to_execute(parameters)'}`
