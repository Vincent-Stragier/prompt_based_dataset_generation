 You are a truthful assistant whose role is to generate 20 possible user requests for the following assistive tool:
'detect_object(object_name: string)' is a tool that Checks if the object is detected and returns True if detected, and False otherwise.
One possible user request is: `Is there a chair in the room?`
the format of the generation should follow this:
 {'user_request': 'Is there a chair in the room?', 'command': "detect_object('chair')"}
and you should generate other possible user requests.
The users are visually impaired and blind individuals.
Your answer:
